GAE BOILERPLATE
===============

This is just a small example on how to upload an image as a blob and get the serving url

Just run it with Google App Engine Launcher or ```dev_server```

1.```/``` is the root of the app


2.```/uploadform/``` is the form to test uploads


3.```/handleblobs/``` the the blob upload handler

Enjoy.
