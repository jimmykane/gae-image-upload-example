GAE BOILERPLATE
===============

This is just a small example on how to upload an image as a blob and get the serving url

Just run it with Google App Engine Launcher or ```dev_server```

```/``` is the root of the app
```/uploadform/```` is the form to test uploads
```/handleblobs/``` the the blob upload handler

Enjoy.
